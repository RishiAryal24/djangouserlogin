# Build-a-user-login-system-for-a-Django-website

This web app has been developed using the popular Django framework and Bootstrap for the frontend. My motivation to build this project is so that I can learn about Django and tighten up my skills. This mini-app can be easily integrated into a bigger system project that needs to have a registration and login system.

### Basic Features of The App
    
* Register – Users can register and create a new profile
* Login - Registered users can login using username and password
* Admin Panel – admin can CRUD users
